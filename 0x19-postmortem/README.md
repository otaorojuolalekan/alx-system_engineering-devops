[Postmortem: Access Issue Due to ALX Sandbox Update](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/postmortem-analysis-mitigation-olalekan-otaoroju/?published=t)

**Incident Overview:
On Aug 1, 2023, an incident occurred where a fellow engineer was locked out of their webservers and load-balancer server due to a change in the ALX provided sandbox environment. The engineer's inability to access the specific sandbox in which their SSH private key was stored led to a disruption in their ability to manage and maintain the servers.

**Incident Timeline:

#Aug 1, 2023: ALX sandboxes were updated as part of routine maintenance.
#Aug 2, 2023: The engineer attempted to access their servers and load-balancer server but found themselves locked out due to an inability to access the required sandbox.
#Aug 5, 2023: The engineer reached out to me to share their access issue and express their frustration about the potential impact on ongoing projects.
#Aug 5, 2023:  I quickly engaged with the engineer to gather more details about the issue and potential solutions.
#Aug 5, 2023: I asked the engineer if they had their SSH private key saved anywhere outside of the sandbox environment.
#Aug 7, 2023: The engineer confirmed that they had a copy of their SSH private key stored on sticky notes.
#Aug 7, 2023: The colleague and the engineer worked together to replace the old SSH private key with the newly located key in the updated ALX sandbox environment.
#[Aug 7, 2023]: The engineer successfully regained access to their servers and load-balancer server.
#[Aug 8, 2023]: The colleague discussed preventive measures with the engineer, advising them to consider working locally and not solely relying on the ALX sandbox environment.
**Root Cause Analysis:
The primary cause of the incident was the update of the ALX sandboxes, which led to the engineer being unable to access the specific sandbox containing their SSH private key. The sandbox update resulted in a configuration mismatch that prevented the engineer's successful authentication to the servers.

**Mitigation and Resolution:
To address the immediate access issue, the colleague swiftly assisted the engineer in locating their saved SSH private key and replacing it in the new sandbox environment. This allowed the engineer to regain access to their servers and continue their work.

**Preventive Measures:
To prevent a recurrence of this incident and similar access-related issues in the future, the following measures have been recommended:

**Local Work Environment: Engineers are advised to maintain a local work environment where critical files, including SSH private keys, are securely stored and backed up. Relying solely on sandbox environments for crucial files poses risks in the event of unexpected changes or disruptions.
Regular Backups: Engineers should implement a regular backup strategy for critical files and configurations to prevent loss of access due to unexpected incidents.
Version Control: For code and configurations, utilizing version control systems (e.g., Git) helps maintain a history of changes and provides an additional layer of security against data loss.
Documentation: Clear documentation of access credentials, configurations, and recovery procedures should be maintained, making it easier to address similar incidents in the future.
Testing Environments: Engineers should consider setting up personal testing environments to validate changes before deploying them to production systems.
Lessons Learned:
This incident underscores the importance of not solely relying on sandbox environments for critical files and configurations. By maintaining local backups, implementing version control, and following best practices for access management, engineers can mitigate the impact of unexpected changes and disruptions.

**Conclusion:
The collaboration between the colleague and the engineer successfully resolved the access issue caused by the ALX sandbox update. Through quick action and careful consideration of preventive measures, the incident was addressed, and valuable lessons were learned to enhance the team's practices moving forward.
